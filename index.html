	<h1> Fitts Law Test: Fingure vs Surface Pen </h1>
	<h2>Aurthors: Marissa Bueno, Dillon Elliott, Sean Shaifubahrim</h2>
	</div>
	<div><p><b> Summary:</b> This study will use the FittsStudy program from <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/>Jake Wobbrock</a>. The user will be tested on how quickly they can perform each task with their finger as a pointer or a stylus as a pointer. For this study we used a Surface Pro and a Surface Pro Stylus Pen. The user would have circles of equal sized equally spaced on a larger circle. The subject will have to press on the circle that is a different color(blue) than the rest. Then, that circle will immediately turn to the same color as the rest and another circle at the opposite end of the larger circle will change color(blue) so the user can anticipate the next selection. 
	</p>
	<p>The test was conducted by two individuals Marissa Bueno and Sean Shaifubahrim. Each subject had 9 different test witch was the combination of 3 different sized circles around 3 different sized circles, for each of the methods. 18 tests total for each subject. Marissa was the first subject to conduct the test using her fingure. She then did it with the Surface Pro 3 Stylus. Next Sean did each test first with the Surface Pro 3 Stylus then his fingure.</p>

<p> Above is the results from Marissa's tests. On the <b>left</b> is the data when she used the stylus. the <b>right</b> is when she used her own finger. The x axis is a scale of dificulty of the tasks. For more info on how that is calculated please visit <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/>Jake Wobbrock</a>. In simple terms the smaller the IDe the less difficult the task is. The above data shows that the stylus performs better since it slope is 91.95 while the fingure is 149.2. This means that as the task gets more difficult, then the time to perform a it will grow faster when using a fingure rather then, a stylus.  </p>

<p> Sean's data also shows that the stylus (<b>right</b>>) out performs his finger (<b>left</b>), as can be shown in the above graphs. </p>

	<div><p><b>Conclusion:</b> The data from only two subjects in the very loose enviremnt, shows that there could possibly be a differnce in performance between useing a pen stylus vs a fingure as a pointer. The data is only gather between two subjects and shows that the pen performs better. To make a more concrete conclusion the study size should be increased and use a more diversed group. Both Marissa and Sean are computer science majors and may have more or lack specific experiences that can makes the data bias. </p> </div>
